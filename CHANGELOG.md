# Changelog

All notable changes to Merchant Presets are recorded here. The format follows

body of its GitHub release.

Add an entry under **Unreleased** in the same pull request as the change, under
_Added_, _Changed_, _Fixed_ or _Removed_, written for players and GMs rather
than for the code. Reference the issue or PR it closes.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Buying an animal puts a copy of its SRD stat block in the world, ready to
  drop on a scene (#15)
- Buying a meal offers to eat it on the spot (#14)

### Changed

- Shopkeeper tokens are neutral rather than friendly; a shop recipe can set
  `disposition` to override (#16)

### Fixed

- Broken icons on the spell-component gems (#13)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- Shops open and close on the world clock, driving Item Piles' own open/closed
  status from Foundry's world time. On by default; the setting hands every shop
  back to always-open (#5)
- Every shopkeeper carries an SRD 5.2 stat block that escalates with the
  settlement size. Gear is tagged so it never reaches the shelf and restocking
  never treats it as merchandise (#9)
- _Shop stock is not carried_ — an opt-in setting that cancels the weight of
  the stock so the Encumbrance variant rule only counts the shopkeeper's own
  kit (#8)

### Changed

- The `drink` goods kind is renamed `food-drink` (#6)
- The generator no longer indexes the SRD equipment pack's folders, so a stock
  line named "Potions" cannot resolve to a folder (#4)
- README: accurate Merchant Goods counts, status badges; build instructions
  moved to CONTRIBUTING (#3)
- Releases are gated on the CI validation (#10)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- Fifty-one SRD 5.2 shops as Item Piles merchants — seventeen stores in
  Village, Town and City sizes, each pre-stocked and priced
- Opt-in restocking that preserves flags and refills the till
- Containers stocked as separate items, one each
- Original item descriptions and SRD prices throughout
